# Path-With-Minimum-Effort-in-javaProblem

You are given an m x n grid of heights.
You can move up, down, left, right.
The effort of a path = the maximum absolute height difference between two consecutive cells along the path.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from (0,0) to (m-1,n-1).

Example

Input: heights = [
  [1,2,2],
  [3,8,2],
  [5,3,5]
]
Output: 2

Path: (0,0)â†’(0,1)â†’(0,2)â†’(1,2)â†’(2,2)
Efforts: [1,0,0,3] â†’ max = 3
But better path gives max = 2

ðŸ”¹ Intuition

This is like shortest path in weighted graph, where:

Each cell is a node.

Edge weight = |height[a] - height[b]|.

We want a path minimizing the maximum edge weight along the path.


Approaches:

1. Binary Search + BFS/DFS â†’ check feasibility for effort mid.


2. Dijkstra âœ… more efficient:

Instead of summing weights, keep track of the max edge so far.

Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always expand the path with least current effort.
